# Linux note

first-class:

**cd /etc** → goto a new file structure ,

in etc folder structure we see all kind of infromation like user root,password, infromation and apps whcih are install in.

to cheak which are using type→  **echo $SHELL**→ see what name of the shell

if we want use bash but we see we are not in bash then we cheak where bash is for seen this type → **which bash** → its show the location of bash

for creat an  file in linux first write → nano [myscript.sh](./myscript.sh) → here   we write what we want → for save → control O → then save extension(as we declear our extension first so )  hit enter → control x → for exit the operation now we see the file by ls command.

for change the file mode →sudo chmod +x [myscript.sh]->(./myscript.sh) (filename)→ ls→ ans show by change the colors.

for run the script what we wrtite → ./myscript.sh→ here . means this folder and the name refer the file.

to see what we write in a scipt →cat myscript.sh
